        "A painting company has determined that for every 112 square feet of wall space, one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company charges $35.00 per hour for labor. Write a program that asks the user to enter the square feet of wall space to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon. The program should display the following data:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The number of gallons of paint required\n",
        "* The hours of labor required\n",
        "* The cost of the paint\n",

        "Following the six-steps problem solving methodology, Design and implement the solution following good programming practices, such as modularising code, validating inputs, handling errors properly, and adhering to the PEP8 style guide.\n",

        "* Appropriate use of comments\n",
        "* Reference any relevant forums, websites, videos that you used.\n",
        "* Use of space and indentation to program is easy to read."
